# Weaving Groups

Some people have been coming to Dweb Camp for years, know the culture, the
patterns, have a crew. If you're new this can be hard to approach. Weaving
groups are offered as an approachable point of contact.

## Process

We form small groups on the first day, made up of:
- a weaver: someone with knowledge/ experience to host + guide the group
- old hands: 1 or more people who've been to dweb before
- new folks: it's your first time!

We meet for a short time at the end of each day to connect, share highlights,
reflect a little.

- small groups: many people find large groups intimidating, so meeting in small
  groups is a way to make a cosier more personable space.
- old hands: having a people who've been before means rather than reading some
  manual, you can ask questions directly of a person who can share their
  experience. They also likely know where to find things / people if they can't
  answer a specific question

## What to discuss in Weaving Groups

What each group discusses will vary based on participants. The guiding
principle is that weaving is there to help people arrive.

That can take many forms:
- getting to know a little more about a few people in the camp
- the chance to share something and be heard
- sparking curiosity through peeks into others experience
- a group you can ask questions of to help wayfind

The first time you meet is a great time to share your name and some context
about where you're from. It could be a "round" where each person answers 3
questions:
1. where did you travel here from?
2. what's something you're passionate about / love to do?
3. what's your name?

### Mix's recipe

I run weaving circles fairly simply with these phases:
- business: "does anyone have any questions / need help with anything?"
- simple round: "what is one thing you loved from today?"
  - a "round" is where each person gets to speak (~2 mins each)
  - allow minimal curious questions, but gently keep it moving
- pick a path: "the structured part is done, we have X mins till dinner, how
  would you like to spend it?"
  1. open conversation about something someone raised
  2. pair walks: pair up with someone, go for a 15 min walk and just talk,
     once you're done just head off to dinner / whatever
  3. discuss what you're looking fwd to tmrw
- close: "we're X mins before dinner, I'd like to draw us to a close"
  - I like a clear close, otherwise the energy / focus tapers off, people drift
    off, and it can get weird :P
  - people can hang around and continue to talk of course!
  - reminder of time + place

### Mikey's recipe

1. Sit in a circle
2. Start with a check-in round: "How are you feeling?"
3. Then pass around any number of other questions
   - What's the story of how you arrived here?
   - What's your relationship to the decentralized web?
   - What's a community that helped raise you?
   - Where do you feel your attention is focused lately?
   - What questions are you reflecting on at the moment?
   - What is something unique to you that you bring to DWeb Camp?
   - What's something that people wouldn't know about you by looking at you?
   - What's something you ate last week that you really enjoyed?
   - How do you like to spend your energy?
4. Your group may evolve, go with what feels right

### Great questions

- What are you currently trying to unlearn?
- what is a memory, image, smell, food or noise from your childhood that...(i.e. reminds you of home/safety)
- what were you surprised by / not surprised by?
- use a cards game call "We are not really strangers" - every attendee has the
  chance to pick their questions or uses one already on the table

## FAQ - Participants

1. **Are weaving groups just for new people?**
   - No! If you're an "old hand" there is a lot you can both offer AND gain
     from participating:
     - extending the culture that you would like to see prosper
     - sharing knowledge / experience
     - meeting new people / ideas (break out of your silo!)

2. **Are weaving groups compulsory?**
   - No. Highly recommended, and optional.
   - If you do join a weaving group, please commit to coming each night, it
     saves groups re-organising and waiting in case people do / don't show up.

## FAQ - Weavers

1. **I don't know everything, what if someone asks a question I don't know how
   to answer?**
   - Totally normal. You can say you don't know and but that you can help find
     the right person to ask
   - You might also ask the group - there's a decent chance there's another
     participant who knows.

## History

Weaving is a pattern which was adopted from the Enspiral community (via
Scuttlebutt), where there has been a history of yearly gatherings. In that
context it was called "home groups".

In the Dweb context weaving has been run since 2019, and it's been an opt-in.
